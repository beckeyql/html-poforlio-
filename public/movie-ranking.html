<p>I really like this sci-fi movie, although it's rated 18+ due to its bloddy storyline. However, the visuals are stunning and the plot is also very good. </p>

<h3>The Lake House</h3>

<p>This is also a sci-fi movie that tells the story of a couple living in different timelines and their journey of overcoming all difficutiles to finally be together. <br />The movie has a beautiful theme song that perfectly complements the story</p>
